# Hardware and Software
## Basic Hardware
- Hardware
	Hardware is the term for the physical components of a computer.
- Software
	Software is the term for the programs that instruct the computer what to do.
- CPU
	CPU or Central Processing Unit is the Hardware that runs program instructions and controls other hardware.
- ALU
	The ALU or Arithmetic Logic Unit perform arithmetic and logic operations on binary integers.
- CU
	The CU or Control Unit tells the computer components such as memory, the ALU and I/O devices, how to respond to computer instructions.
- RAM
	RAM or Random Access Memory is hardware that stores data, while a program runs.
- Keyboard
	Hardware for input that allows the user to type characters.
- Screen
	Hardware for output that displays characters and images to a user.
- clock
	The speed at which a CPU runs instructions is governed by a ticking clock signal.
- gigahertz
	One gigahertz, or 1 GHz, means 1billion tick per second.

## Cache, Memory, and Drives
- clock frequency
	clock ticks per second is called the clock frequency
- drive
	a computer's drive stores date even after electricity is turned off.
- HDD
	HDD or Hard Disk Drive consists of a spinning disk that uses magnetism to store bits.
- SSD 
	SSD or Solid State Drive is more common than HDD and implements a solid chip to store data and has no moving parts.
- cache
	for faster running programs, many CPUs internally have an additional small faster memory called a cache to provide ultra-fast access to the currently needed instructions and data.
- non-volatile
	A storage device that stores data after electricity has been turned off is said to be non-volatile.
- USB Flash Drive
	A USB flash drive is a non-volatile storage device that a user can connect to a computer via USB port.
- Flash
	Flash is a particular kind of non-volatile storage technology with the feature that large blocks of data can be erased simultaneously.
## Type of computers
- Server
	A server is a computer that delivers (serves) items like web pages, documents, or videos to other computers over a network. Typically with no keyboard or screen.
- PC/ desktop
	A PC or Personal Computer is typically used by a few people in a home or office, includes a keyboard and screen, and runs various applications like office productivity, web access, games, etc.
- Laptop
	A laptop is a portable PC, smaller/lighter than a desktop
